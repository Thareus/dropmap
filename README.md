A simple singular webpage for users to visualise a file of UK-based locations.

Users can drop in an excel or csv file.

They can then geocode that data (if there is a UK postcode) if necessary.

Finally, they can visualise that data on a map.

Columns that can be identified as suitable for filtering are created as filters and colour overlays.

Available as a page here:  https://thareus.github.io/dropmap/
